# Movement Tech
Allows for double jumps and slamming in BL2. Double jumps are simple and just require you to press jump in the air to jump again.

Slamming has a few mechanics that go into it, pressing crouch while in the air causes you to quickly speed down towards the ground, if you are high enough in the air when starting the slam, you will cause a slam explosion on impact. The minimum height for a slam explosion is slightly higher than normal jump height so you can use the double jump to get just the height you need for a slam explosion.
